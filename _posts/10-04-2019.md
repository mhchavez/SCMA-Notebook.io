# DATA ANALYSIS


**Objective**
- Analyse our data using diverse Alpha and Beta diversity metrics

## simplifying our data Names
For the following steps of data analysis, intead of using the long names of the final files we have created, we are going to renamed them using the following commands. **But!** to not lost our original files in the command the deleteold option is set as False.

    mothur> rename.file(count=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.denovo.vsearch.pick.pick.count_table, tree=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.phylip.tre, shared=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.opti_mcc.shared, constaxonomy=stability.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.opti_mcc.0.03.cons.taxonomy,prefix=final, deleteold=f)

Now our files were renamed to:

<p align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/nt5_1.jpg"></p>
                                              
## Analysis !

**1. Checking # of sequences per sample**

     mothur>count.groups(shared=final.opti_mcc.shared )

<p align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/nt5_2.jpg"></p>

The lower # of sequences is 74605, which is a good number. Be aware if a sample ended up with very low # of sequences (Though I am not what is a good limit here)

Output:
<ul>
  <li>final.opti_mcc.count.summary</li>
</ul>
 
 **2. Rarefying the data**
 In this step we will rarefy our data to the lowest # of sequences in our samples *74605*.
 
    mothur> sub.sample(shared=final.opti_mcc.shared ,size=74605)
 
 Output:
 
 <ul><li>final.opti_mcc.0.03.subsample.shared</li></ul>
 
 A view into the file shows us know that all the samples have the same # of OTUS, and they sumup to the number of sequences specified.

### Alpha Diversity

**1. Rarefaction**
  
  Know we are going to apply rarefaction into our data, **(remember rarefy and rarefaction are not the same)**
  
    mothur> rarefaction.single(shared=final.opti_mcc.shared ,calc=sobs,freq=100)
  
 Output:
 
 <ul><li>final.opti_mcc.groups.rarefaction></li></ul
  
  The folowing images are the view of the created file, to create a rarefaction curve we need to take the numsamples row which are the # of OTUS that can be find at certain number of sequences (sampling effort), this files has three rows per sample, the fisrt one starting with 003-nameofsample is the one that we will use. 
  
   <p align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/nt5_5.jpg"><img src="/IMAGES/nt5_6.jpg"></p>
  
 In the rarefaction curve most of them are still increasing, this tell us that we could find more diversity, DMNS16482 though seems to be arriving to a plateau state, which could means that almost all the diversity in this sample has been discovered.
 
**2. Simpson**

    mothur> summary.single(shared=final.opti_mcc.shared,calc=nseqs-coverage-sobs-invsimpson,subsample=74605)

Output:
<ul>
  <li>final.opti_mcc.groups.ave-std.summary</li>
  <li>final.opti_mcc.groups.summary</li>
<ul>
  
**insert results and comments here**

**3. Heatmap**

Below there is a way to create heatmaps, but the output is not that good!(visually speaking).

    mothur> heatmap.bin(shared=final.opti_mcc.0.03.subsample.shared,scale=log2,numotu=50)

Output:
  <ul><li>final.opti_mcc.0.03.subsample.0.03.heatmap.bin.svg</li><ul>

### Beta Diversity
**1. 

    mothur> dist.shared(shared=final.opti_mcc.shared,calc=thetayc-jclass,subsample=74605)
    
Output:
<ul>
  <li>final.opti_mcc.thetayc.0.03.lt.ave.dist</li>
  <li>final.opti_mcc.thetayc.0.03.lt.std.dist</li>
  <li>final.opti_mcc.jclass.0.03.lt.ave.dist</li>
  <li>final.opti_mcc.jclass.0.03.lt.std.dist</li>
</ul>
