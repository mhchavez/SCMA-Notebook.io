## CREATING METADATA FILE 

### Sample data description

**The chipmunk data:** you can download the fasta file here **put here a link for the data**  is from a very small study looking at some chipmunks in the Inland Northwest (USA). It contains fecal microbiome data from two different subspecies of red-tailed chipmunk. 

In the next table is some information about the animals, the "metadata", including their subspecies (Tamias ruficaudus ruficaudus or T. r. simulans), where the animals were trapped, their mitochondrial haplotype and their sex.

To start analyzing data in mothur we need to construct a file called **stability.file** -the name can change to any other that you like- this is the first step before actually working with mothur. bellow there are two methods for creating this file.
But first we need to know what are the names of the reads that we got. This is in the Chipmunk data set moved into our working directories in the cluster.

### First method:

1. Creating a metadata files with notepad called stability.txt

<img align="center" src="/IMAGES/stabilitytxt.PNG"/>
2. Transfer stability file in ~/usr11/chipmunk_fastq using WinSCP
3. To check the content of the transferred file go to: ~home/CAM/mcb5896usr11/chipmunk_fastq/ and type the following command
         
         Bash$ cat.stability.txt

<img align="center" src="/IMAGES/catstability1.PNG"/ widht="60%" >

### Second method:

1. Load mothur 
         
         Bash$ module load mothur/1.42.3 
         Bash$ mothur 
         mothur> make.file(inputdir=chipmunk_fastq, type=fastq, prefix=stability) 
   
   NOTE: quit from mothur to move into chipmunk_fastq (use cd and ls commands)
   This command can be done jsut if you have the original information named in a fashion that allows mothur to assign the reads with the    samples
   
2. Checking the created file 

        Bash$ cat stability.files
    
    <img align="center" src="/IMAGES/catstability2.PNG"/>
