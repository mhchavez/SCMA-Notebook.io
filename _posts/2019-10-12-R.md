**Objective:**
<ol>
  <li> Prepare data obtained from mothur to be able to work in R</li>
  <li> Analyse data by alpha and beta diversity using R </li>
</ol>

## About R

I am working with Rstudio V. 3.6.1. Also, I have installed the library packages : phyloseq, ggplot2 and ape.
Everytime we start working we have to call this libraries

	R> library(phyloseq)
	R> library(ggplot2)
	R> library(ape)
	
## Preparing the files

1. In order to work in R we need to have handy (copy them from the cluster to a local directory where we are going to run R) the following files:

<ul>
  <li> final.cons.taxonomy</li>
  <li> final.shared</li>
  <li> X.design file</li>
</ul>

The *X.design* file is not other than the metadata related to our experiment, we can prepare it in a text editor as notepad.

2. Then we have to call the mothur files and giving them a name in R

     	R> mothurConsTax = "~/GRAD SCHOOL/SMCA/Chipmunk/final.cons.taxonomy"
      	R> mothurShared="~/GRAD SCHOOL/SMCA/Chipmunk/final.opti_mcc.shared"
 
3. We will create a data object based on the taxonomy and shared files
 
      	R> miseq.tax<-import_mothur(mothur_constaxonomy_file=mothurConsTax,mothur_shared_file=mothurShared)
      	R> miseq.tax

<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_1.jpg"></p>
 
 4. Now we will call and merge the metadata (information about our samples) with miseq.tax that have the OTUS information
 
      	R> mothurMap2="~/GRAD SCHOOL/SMCA/Chipmunk/chipmunk.design2"
      	R> mothurMap2=read.table(file="~/GRAD SCHOOL/SMCA/Chipmunk/chipmunk2.design",header=T)
      	R> mothurMap2

<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_2.jpg"></p>
  
      	R> mothurMap2<-sample_data(mothurMap2)
     	R> rownames(mothurMap2)<-mothurMap2$Sample
      	R> miseq.tax.merge2<-merge_phyloseq(miseq.tax,mothurMap2)
      	R> miseq.tax.merge2
  
<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_3.jpg"></p>
 
 **Finally, we have all our files!**
 
 ## Analyzing ..

**1. Rarefying**

To start working with our data, the first step is Rarefy our data to be able to compare data that has the same "effort" (as we did in mothur)
  
   	R> m.t.rare<-rarefy_even_depth(miseq.tax.merge2,sample.size=min(sample_sums(miseq.tax.merge2)))
	

This command will rarefy to the lowest # of sequences. Lets say we have 2 samples one with 10 and other with 5 sequences, then this command will rarefy both samples to 5 sequences. In mothur we gave the command 7460 as the smalest number of sequences among the samples. In the following image R tell us how many sequences were removed, 
  
 <P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R2_1.jpg"></p>

 But to know to how much we kept we have to tell it to shows us the count
  
    	R> sample_sums(*putfilenamehere*)
    
The following picture shows us the total number of sequences before and after rarefying

<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_5.jpg"></p>
    
And we can also plot this results:

  	R> plot(sample_sums(miseq.tax))

 <P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/Rplot_1.jpg"><img src="/IMAGES/Rplot_2.jpg"></p>

**2. Bar plots for Bacterial composition**

**2.1** First we will call the ranks, these are the taxonomy levels 

	R> rank_names(m.t.rare)

<img src="/IMAGES/R2_2.jpg">

**2.2** Now, we can plot our samples base on one taaxonomy level

	R> plot_bar(m.t.rare,fill="Rank2")

This gives us a warning 

<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R2_3.jpg"></p>

**2.3** We can normalize  our samples counts to express in terms of fractions 

	R> m.t.rare.tr<-transform_sample_counts(m.t.rare,function(x) x/sum(x))
	R> plot_bar(m.t.rare.tr,fill="Rank2")
	
<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_13.jpeg"></p>

**2.4** But still we have those black lines which are OTUS limits, to get rid of them we use:

	R> psdat.ph<-tax_glom(m.t.rare,taxrank="Rank2")
	R> ps.melt<-psmelt(psdat.ph)
	R> plot_bar(psdat.ph,fill="Rank2")

<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_14.jpeg"></p>

**2.5** Now once removed those black limits we can transform again the data to express the abundance in terms of fractions

	R> m.t.rare.tr2<-transform_sample_counts(psdat.ph,function(x) x/sum(x))
	R> plot_bar(m.t.rare.tr2,fill="Rank2")

<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_15.jpeg"></p>

**Interpretation** As we can see in this final bar plot in all the samples the most dominant phylum are Bacteriodetes. It could be more useful to check the average compositon by other variables.

	R> > plot_bar(m.t.rare.tr2,x="Trapped",fill="Rank2")
	
<Table align="center">
	<tr>
	<td><img src="/IMAGES/Ra.jpeg"></td>
	<td><img src="/IMAGES/Rb.jpeg"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td> Subspecies</td><td> Sex </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><img src="/IMAGES/Rc.jpeg"></td><td><img src="/IMAGES/Rd.jpeg"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Location Trapped</td><td>Mitochondrial Origin</td>
	</tr>
</table>

**Interpretation:** I was expecting to have the other variables abundance expressed in fraction but instead is giving me a sum of the samples per variable. Nevertheless we can still see that the more abundant Phylum is Bacteriodetes no matter the Sex, the location the Chipmunk were trapped or the mithocondrial origin. We might need to check deeper perhaps look at the Genus level to find some differences.


**3. Alpha diversity**

At this point we can obtain alpha diversity indexes using:

	R> plot_richness(m.t.rare)
	
	Warning message:
	Removed 45 rows containing missing values (geom_errorbar). 

<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_16.jpeg"></p>

To Narrow them down to just two of these indexes based on one of the variables, for example sex (to check the other variables change the value of x).

	R> plot_richness(m.t.rare, x="Sex", measures=c("Chao1", "Shannon"))
	
<Table align="center">
	<tr>
	<td><img src="/IMAGES/R_17.jpeg"><td></td><img src="/IMAGES/R_18.jpeg"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td> Sex</td><td>Subspecies </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><img src="/IMAGES/R_19.jpeg"></td><td><img src="/IMAGES/R_20.jpeg"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td> Location (Trapped)</td><td>Mithocondrial content (putmt)</td>
	</tr>
</table>


**Intepretation:**
Remembering that: *Shannon = include abundance in the calculation; measure of entropy; how likely you are to know what species an organism that is pulled at random from a community is. Higher Shannon = more entropy = more diversity (From class notes,SMCA#5)*

In other words it expresses the eveness of the comunity, and as it is an alpha diversity index it is unique per comunity (the eveness within the comunity)


**4. Beta OrdinationS**

Beta ordination compare the comunities one to each other

	R>m.t.rare.ord.bc<-ordinate(m.t.rare, "NMDS","bray")
	R>m.t.rare.bc = plot_ordination(m.t.rare,m.t.rare.ord.bc,color="Sex", shape="Sex") + geom_point(size=7) + scale_colour_brewer(palette="Set1") + geom_text(aes(label=group),hjust=0,vjust=2)
	R>m.t.rare.bc

<P align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/R_21.jpeg"></p>

And we can do the same for all the different variables
