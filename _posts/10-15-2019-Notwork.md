# SOMETIMES (or many)... Things does not Work

## In R

Once we have our files in a new directory to start working with R, we needed to rarefy

So, I was doing the following commands:
	 
        R> mothurConsTax = "direction"
        R> mothur_shared_file="mothurShared"
        R> miseq.tax<-import_mothur(mothur_constaxonomy_file=mothurConsTax,mothur_shared_file=mothurShared)
	      R> mothurMap=read.table(file="~/GradSchool/SCMA/Chipmunk/chipmunk.time.design",header=T)
        R> mothurMap
        
        R> miseq.tax.ps<-merge_phyloseq(miseq.tax,mothurMap)
        R> miseq.tax.ps
Â 
And my merge file looked like this:

<p align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/ntwtable2.jpg"></p>

I found odd that it was not listing the number of samples and the variables (as we can see in the sript for my good run)

First, I though It could be that in class we worked with a "x.design" file of only two variable and maybe I had to reduce it. I modified the file to only two variables and re-run the previous code, but it did not work either.

Then, reviewing notes from before I found out that we need to tell R which are our samples in the table. So I run a trial using

    R> mothurMap=read.table(file="~/GRAD SCHOOL/SMCA/Chipmunk/chipmunk.design",header=T)
    R> mothurMap

<p align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/ntwtable.jpg"></p>
     
    R>mothurMap<-sample_data(mothurMap)
    R> rownames(mothurMap)<-mothurMap$**group**
    R> miseq.tax.merge<-merge_phyloseq(miseq.tax,mothurMap)
    R> miseq.tax.merge
    

<p align="center"><img src="/IMAGES/ntwtable3.jpg"></p>

And Finally! I got a good merge file, but only with my two variables. In the script I presented the code that works, and created a 
XX.design file with all my variables knowing that this time it will work.
