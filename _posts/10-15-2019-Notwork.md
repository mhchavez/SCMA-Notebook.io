Once we have our files in a new directory to start working with R, we needed to rarefy

So I was doing the following commands
	 
        R> mothurConsTax = "direction"
        R> mothur_shared_file="mothurShared"
        R> miseq.tax<-import_mothur(mothur_constaxonomy_file=mothurConsTax,mothur_shared_file=mothurShared)
	      R> mothurMap=read.table(file="~/GradSchool/SCMA/Chipmunk/chipmunk.time.design",header=T)
        R> mothurMap
        
        R> miseq.tax.ps<-merge_phyloseq(miseq.tax,mothurMap)
        R> miseq.tax.ps
Â 
And my merge file looked like this

otu_table()   OTU Table:         [ 3461 taxa and 9 samples ]
tax_table()   Taxonomy Table:    [ 3461 taxa by 6 taxonomic ranks ]

I found odd that it was not listing the number of samples and the variables (as we can see in the sript for my good run)

First I though It could be that in class we worked with a *.design file of only two variable and maybe I had to reduce it. I modified the file to only two vairable and rerun the previous code but
did not work either.

Then Reviewing notes from before I found that we need to tell R which are our samples in the table. So I run a trial using

    R> mothurMap=read.table(file="~/GRAD SCHOOL/SMCA/Chipmunk/chipmunk.design",header=T)
    R> mothurMap
      group    species
1 DMNS16474   simulans
2 DMNS16475   simulans
3 DMNS16476   simulans
4 DMNS16477   simulans
5 DMNS16478   simulans
6 DMNS16479   simulans
7 DMNS16482 ruficaudus
8 DMNS16483 ruficaudus
9 DMNS16484 ruficaudus
    
    R>mothurMap<-sample_data(mothurMap)
    R> rownames(mothurMap)<-mothurMap$**group**
    R> miseq.tax.merge<-merge_phyloseq(miseq.tax,mothurMap)
    R> miseq.tax.merge
    
phyloseq-class experiment-level object
otu_table()   OTU Table:         [ 3461 taxa and 9 samples ]
sample_data() Sample Data:       [ 9 samples by 2 sample variables ]
tax_table()   Taxonomy Table:    [ 3461 taxa by 6 taxonomic ranks ]

And Finally! I got a good merge file, but only wiht my two variables. In the script I presented the code as it should work and created a *design file with all my variables knowing that this time it will work.
