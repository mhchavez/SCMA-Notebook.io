The first step after getting the readings is to evaluate the quality of the data. 
In the cluster we need a new directory (I named mine as Metagenomics)


        bash-4.2$ pwd
        /home/CAM/mcb5896/usr11
        bash-4.2$ ls
        chipmunk_fastq  mothur.1567784410.logfile  mothur.1571401653.logfile
        fastqcStuff     mothur.1567875472.logfile  mothur.1571417701.logfile
        Miseq_batch     mothur.1570745423.logfile  SRR100123.fastq
        MiSeq_SOP       mothur.1571018318.logfile  transferThisText.txt

  And moved into it the reads that I will be analyzing
  
        bash-4.2$ mkdir Metagenomics
        bash-4.2$ cd Metagenomics/
        bash-4.2$ cp /home/CAM/mcb5896/classFiles/HMP_1.fastq.gz .
        bash-4.2$ ls
        HMP_1.fastq.gz
        
Notice that the file us compressed and then we need to "unziped" it.


bash-4.2$ cd Metagenomics/
bash-4.2$ ls
HMP_1.fastq.gz
bash-4.2$ gunzip HMP_1.fastq.gz
bash-4.2$ LS
bash: LS: command not found
bash-4.2$ ls
HMP_1.fastq

And know we load and run the fastqc module Version 0.11.7 (you will have to installed before if it is not present in the cluster)

      bash-4.2$ module load fastqc/0.11.7
      bash-4.2$ fastaqc /home/CAM/mcb5896/usr11/Metagenomics/HMP_1.fastq
      bash: fastaqc: command not found
      bash-4.2$ fastqc /home/CAM/mcb5896/usr11/M
      Metagenomics/ Miseq_batch/  MiSeq_SOP/
      bash-4.2$ fastqc /home/CAM/mcb5896/usr11/Metagenomics/HMP_1.fastq
      
      Started analysis of HMP_1.fastq
      Approx 10% complete for HMP_1.fastq
      Approx 25% complete for HMP_1.fastq
      Approx 35% complete for HMP_1.fastq
      Approx 50% complete for HMP_1.fastq
      Approx 60% complete for HMP_1.fastq
      Approx 75% complete for HMP_1.fastq
      Approx 90% complete for HMP_1.fastq
      Analysis complete for HMP_1.fastq

As a result we have the following files:

      bash-4.2$ ls
      HMP_1.fastq  HMP_1_fastqc.html  HMP_1_fastqc.zip

Then the *.html file has the information about the quality of our sequenced read, we need to transfer it into our computers and it will open ina internet explorer
